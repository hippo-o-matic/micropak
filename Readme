Micropak, a basic header library for archiving files
You probably shouldn't use this for anything serious

In case this library is updated in the future, there is backwards compatability for any archives packed with previous release builds.
If you want to save on space and only use the latest unpacker version, delete anything between the //OLD//VERSIONS lines.
All commands are stored under the "micropak" namespace, these include:

micropak::pack(std::string dirname, std::string outname);


micropak::unpack(std::string input_file, std::string output_dir);


micropak::getVersion(std::string filename); | micropak::getVersion(std::fstream &stream);
gets the version of the library the archive was packed with


This repo also comes with a minimalist example program, archive.cpp. Simply compile with make

Program usage: ./archiver <options>
-p <directory> <file> | Recursively packs all files in <directory> to <file>. Uses <directory>.mpak if <file> not given
-u <file> <directory> | Unpacks an archive, <file>, using <directory> as it's root. Uses <file> as the name if <directory> not given
